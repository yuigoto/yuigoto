Hello! :wave:

The name's **Fabio Y. Goto**, and I'm a **front end developer** from São Paulo, Brazil.

For a long time I've worked as a freelance **full stack PHP** and **WordPress developer**, though in the later years I've been pretty much into **React** development in both **JavaScript** and **TypeScript**. I've also dabbled with **Node.JS** back end development.

Other interests of mine include: game development, photography, music production, sound design.

You can find some of my code below, but there's also tiny bits of me here and there around the web:

P.s.: btw, I hold a _BA in advertising_ too!
